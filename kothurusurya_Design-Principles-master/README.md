Epam Home Task-3 Design Principles.

Implementing Design principles in the Calculator App.<br>
SOLID principle:<br>
-->Single Responsibility Principle: The App class has only one responsibility to take inut and give the resulant output.<br>
-->Open Closed Principle: Software entities are open for extension, but closed for modification.<br>
--> Liskov Substitution Principle: The new derived classes (Add,Sub..) are extending the base classes Mathcommand without changing their behavior<br>
--> Interface segregation principle: Users are not forced to implement the methods Expo() and Modulus() as they donâ€™t use.<br>
--> Dependency Inversion: High level modules are not depending on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.<br>
KISS Principle:<br>
-->Each method solves one small problems, not many use cases. The methods are very small.<br>
DRY Principle:<br>
-->The abstract methods are used as Helper Class,Enterprise Libraries.<br>
YAGNI:<br>
-->When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.<br>
